Description:	Weight configuration interface for nodeN

		The interleave weight for a memory node (N). These weights are
		utilized by processes which have set their mempolicy to
		MPOL_WEIGHTED_INTERLEAVE and have opted into global weights by
		omitting a task-local weight array.

		These weights only affect new allocations, and changes at runtime
		will not cause migrations on already allocated pages.

		Writing an empty string resets the weight value to 1.

		Minimum weight: 1
		Maximum weight: 255
